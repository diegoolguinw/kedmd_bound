## Abstract
In this article, we propose a new error bound for Koopman operator approximation using Kernel Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition. This bound relates to other bounds in the state of the art. The new bound is $O(N^{-1/2})$, with a constant related to the probability of success of the bound, given by Hoeffding's inequality, similar to other methodologies, such as Philipp et al. Furthermore, we propose a \textit{lifting back} operator to obtain trajectories generated by embedding the initial state and iterating a linear system in a higher dimension. This naturally yields an $O(N^{-1/2})$ error bound for mean trajectories. Finally, we show numerical results for different systems, exhibiting successful approximation with exponential decay faster than $-1/2$, as suggested by the theoretical results.
