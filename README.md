## Abstract
In this article we propose a new error bound for Koopman operator approximation by Kernel Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition, relating it with other bounds in the state of the art. The new bound is $O(N^{-1/2})$, with a constant related to the probability of success of the bound, given by Hoeffding inequality, as same as other methodologies, for example Phillip et al. Furthermore, we propose a lifting back operator to obtain the trajectories generated by embed the initial state and iterate a linear system in higher dimension, which naturally has a $O(N^{-1/2})$ error bound for mean trajectories. Finally, we show numerical results for different systems, exhibing a successful approximation with exponential decay faster than $−0.5$, as theorical results shown.
